Implementation of Paper (Road Extraction using Deep Residual UNet)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309343]

Loss function used in the paper is MSE, but in this implementation I have used Dice Loss which works better than MSE for cases when there is class imbalance which is the case with Road Extraction
